## Enumerated Reference

Converts `[@type:reference]` to enumerated reference based on type pattern defined in enumerated
reference definition of the form:

[@type]: Type content [#]

Where [#] is replaced by the ordinal for the actual reference in the document. [@] is equivalent
to [@] when there is no id. It is treated as a placeholder for the ordinal number for the given
type. Outside of a enumerated reference definition it will render `0`
